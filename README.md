# cinemate development using
 React.js and Tailwind CSS, with a focus on implementing
 essential features such as displaying movie titles, short
 summaries, categories, reviews, ratings, budget, revenue,
 release dates, and IMDb links. Additionally, I implemented a
 search bar to find specific movies efficiently.
